# Quick & Dirty Backup

## Overview

QDBackup is a tool for marking sets of files to be synchronized between devices, both locally and remotely and for synchronizing them. It will contain both backup and restore functions.

## Update

After kicking this project around in my head for a few years, I have an entirely different architecture in mind for how to build a system like this. 

## Notes

* Agents like Consul uses
* Smart prioritization
* Completely decentralized? (As a mode or in general?)
* Idempotent configuration in JSON?
* Electron app for tracking?
